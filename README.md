# Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Data Warehouse implementation using **SQL Server**. The architecture follows a **Three-Layer Approach**: **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**. The objective is to efficiently process, cleanse, and structure data to support analytics and reporting using tools like **Power BI** and **Tableau**.

## Architecture Overview
The data warehouse consists of the following three layers:

### 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- This layer is responsible for **ingesting raw data** from various sources.
- The data is stored **without any transformations** to maintain data integrity.
- Acts as a **staging area** for further processing.

### 2. Silver Layer (Data Cleansing & Enrichment)
- This layer **processes and cleanses** the data.
- **Normalization techniques** are applied.
- **Data enrichment and validation** ensure consistency and quality.
- Helps in transforming raw data into a **structured and usable format**.

### 3. Gold Layer (Aggregated & Modeled Data)
- Data is **aggregated and structured** into a **Star Schema** model.
- Supports **efficient reporting and analytics**.
- Enables data analysts to generate insights using **Power BI** and **Tableau**.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: `SQL Server`
- **Data Processing**: `SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)`, `Stored Procedures`
- **Data Modeling**: `Star Schema`, `Normalization`, `Aggregation`
- **Reporting & Visualization**: `Power BI`, `Tableau`

## Project Workflow
1. **Extract** data from various sources into the **Bronze Layer**.
2. **Transform & Cleanse** data in the **Silver Layer** using normalization and validation techniques.
3. **Load & Model** data in the **Gold Layer** to enable efficient reporting.
4. **Consume & Visualize** data using **Power BI** or **Tableau**.

## How to Use
1. Connect **SQL Server** to your data sources and load data into the **Bronze Layer**.
2. Use **SQL queries** and **SSIS** to process and cleanse data in the **Silver Layer**.
3. Design the **Star Schema** and store the aggregated data in the **Gold Layer**.
4. Connect **Power BI** or **Tableau** to the **Gold Layer** for reporting and insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **automation** for ETL processes.
- Integrate with **cloud-based solutions** like `Azure Synapse` or `AWS Redshift`.
- Optimize performance with **indexing and partitioning techniques**.
- Implement **data governance and security measures**.
